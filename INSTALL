In the instructions, ~/jsx will refer to the root directory of Jsx (where this file should be)

To build Jsx, you need:

- OCaml compiler >= 3.12.0 (includes ocamlbuild, ocamldoc, ...)
    from a linux package (make sure version >= 3.12.0)

    or installed from source: http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
       (follow install instructions)
       if cp -p is not allowed on your machine:
       	 Assume you have extracted ocaml sources into ~/ocaml/
         modify ~/ocaml/ocamlbuild/rule.ml: in module Common_commands, replace
           let cp_p src dest = ...
         by
           let cp_p = cp
         and ~/ocaml/ocamlbuild/shell.ml: in function cp_pf, replace "-pf" by "-f"
	 $cd ~/ocaml
	 $cp ~/jsx/install/ocaml/cp .
	 $chmod 755 cp
         $export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
	 you will only need this modified cp to compile ocaml (because a cp -p is hard coded in boot/myocamlbuild.boot)
	 now you can try to compile again

- findlib/ocamlfind
    from a linux package

    or installed from source: http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html
       (follow install instructions)

- menhir
    from a linux package

    or installed from source: http://cristal.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/
       (follow install instructions)

- camlidl
    from a linux package

    or installed from source: http://forge.ocamlcore.org/projects/camlidl/
       (follow install instructions)
       $cd ~/jsx/install/camlidl
       $sudo ocamlfind install camlidl META
       sudo is only needed if ocaml is not locally installed

- my modified version of LambdaJS
    from my git repository: http://mehdi.bouaziz.org/git/lambdaJS/
    Assume you want LambdaJS sources to be in ~/lambdaJS
    $cd
    $git clone http://mehdi.bouaziz.org/git/lambdaJS/
    $cd lambdaJS
    $sudo make install
    sudo is only needed if ocaml is not locally installed

- Z3 linux distribution (tested with version 2.19)
    http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html
    Assume that you have extracted it into ~/z3/
    $cd ~/z3
    $cp -r ~/jsx/install/z3/* .
    $sudo make install
    sudo is only needed if ocaml is not locally installed

Notice:
    Z3 needs at least GLIBC >= 2.4 and GLIBCXX >= 3.4.9
    You won't be able to compile Jsx if you don't have these versions and I cannot help you

To compile Jsx:
$make

To build the documentation:
$make doc
And run your browser on jsx.docdir/index.html
