To build and install Jsx, you need:

- OCaml compiler >= 3.12.0 with ocamlbuild and ocamlfind
- camlidl
- my modified version of LambdaJS
    for example from my read-only git repository:
    http://mehdi.bouaziz.org/git/lambdaJS/
- Z3 linux distribution (tested with version 2.19)
    http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html
- sudo access (only if your OCaml distribution is not installed in a local directory)

Merge the z3 directory of Jsx into the Z3 distribution
Build and install Z3 (sudo make install)
Build and install LambdaJS (sudo make install)
make
