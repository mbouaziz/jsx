Jsx, a symbolic executor for Javascript

For install instructions, read INSTALL

To symbolically execute a .js file, do:
  $./jsx.native myfile.js
Assuming that lambdaJS sources are in ../lambdaJS

If you get an error message about libz3.so, then you need to do once:
  $sudo make ldconf
or
  $export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`ocamlfind query Z3`:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

For further options, do: $./jsx.native -help
